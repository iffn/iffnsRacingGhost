# iffnsRacingGhost
 Racing ghost for SaccFlight

### Git Submodule integration
Add this submodule with the following git command (Assuming the root of your Git project is the Unity project folder)
```
git submodule add https://github.com/iffn/iffnsRacingGhost.git Assets/iffnsStuff/iffnsRacingGhost
```

If you have manually added it, use this one first. (I recommend to close the Unity project first)
```
git rm Assets/iffnsStuff/iffnsRacingGhost -r
```
